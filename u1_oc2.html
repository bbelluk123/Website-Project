<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review)</h2>

<h3>- 2.1 Review the on-going use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
<p>
I found Trello very helpful using the 3 board cards approach 1. To Do,  2. Doing and 3.. Done, it allowed me on boards card 1.tor record what needed  to be done in a local, prioritising what need to be done to complete each stage 1. to 6. Allowing me to record what I was doing at any point in time, thus acting as an aid to memory to then update what been completed, review 1. To Do board card, then update doing etc in a local flow.  Visual Studio Code is very straight forward and logical to use allowing you to code each page with its own start, middle and end. The flow of coding was easy to follow, eg. Stating with heading structure levels, each relevant paragraph, inserting page breaks, list and website link reference when required. What was also helpful was at any stage after input you could review your website HTML file and view each website page layout to identify coding errors, to many page break line spaces, therefore, allowing me to quickly make changes via VSC and review HTML website file again etc.

<h3>- 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
<p>
I feel for my first attempt to website coding etc for a small project in such a short time scale, this approach and tools used was ideal for me as an introductory level. Due to the fact it was based on a personal project I planned, researched and designed etc, made the learning experience a very valuable insight to front end coding, for me it was very enjoyable and allowing me to relate to everything doing the coding page structure and then being able to review the outcome/page(s). Trello was excellent for me it was like my on-line diary which I could review and update during each day. My experience Microsoft word, internet browsing/research etc really assisted me in all stages to, e.g. Microsoft word, I structured each page layout in the coding structure order and was able to do visualise/ do comparisons to each actual page outcome structure and presentation.

<h3>- 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
<p>
Due to timescale  constraints and me being new to coding etc, I was very mindful not to try to over complicate the project task(s) and  was very focused on working to the Waterfall project methodology (1. Plan 2. Research / Analysis 3. Design 4. Code 5.Testing and 6.Implementation & Maintenance), whereby each stage completed in order 1 to 6 and you cannot move on to next stage until stage before it completed/closed.. This worked very well kept me very focused and preventing me deviating away from my original plan, research development and design etc by being tempting to adding more and I feel the Trello 3. Board cards method was very helpful in assisting me. I feel the only major weakness is down to time constraint therefore, I had to keep design etc basic and really focus on ensuring all content/project assignment conditions were achieved within deadline date set.

<h3>- 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
<p>
Due to this being my first time coding anything, it took much longer than I expected coding all narrative etc., for each website page. Therefore, I was left with very little time to work on the presentation/layout view of the website, whereby I was unable to spend alot of time getting use to using CSS to explore all the various styling techniques etc. I also spent time collating a wide range of images of relevant e to the website pages 2 to 5 theme, but was left with very little time  to collate the one’s I wanted to include in the website pages and simply had to make do with colour background for the pages. Therefore, next time I will allocate a specific time frame for both above tasks to ensure achievable.
</p>

<br>

<h3>- 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
<p>
As explained in 2.4 above due to my limited experience my website is basic , although it  is functional and contains all relevant written narrative, e.g. Home Page 1 About Me e.g. a brief description of my career history  and work experience to date and contact details; Pages 2 to 5, whereby each page represents the course work unit and outcome questions and answers. Therefore  I have reviewed and confirm I have achieved the desired outcome within the constraint’s (including time) I encountered completing the project.
