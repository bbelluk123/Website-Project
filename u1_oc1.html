<h3>- 1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
<p>
In the modern world IT is used in every type of small to large muilt-nationals businesses, which has now become vital for every business department’s/ services to carryout out a wide range of functions, e.g. Accountancy, communications, marketing/sales, HR, IT, distribution etc. Beyond any doubt it would be impossible for any business to function without IT including Information Systems (IS)  etc. However, due to evolving use of IT not just for business but personal use to, the threat of cyber-attacks/virus etc and to protect the integrity of data has made the demand for IT and IS Professional greater than supply/availability.

<h3>- 1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
    
<p>
A Digital Project Manager (DPA) needs an understanding of the various Formal Project Management Methodologies in order to make the correct choice for digital project(s), e.g. Waterfall useful for small non-complex short term projects, whereas say Agile which uses the sprint methodology approach is more suitable for long term large complex projects.  However, the DPM skills are very similar whereby the DPM needs to be an organised expert in the field with good planning, leadership /motivational, an eye for detail (e.g. to avoid spelling mistakes, not picking up links not working or flawed user journey) and prompt/excellent delivery of web projects. The resources required would include staff for project team, budget/funding, suitable workspace, equipment and systems e.g. devolpcoding.moodlecloud.com, Visual studio code, GitHub for project coding and testing stages; Trello, Slack for planning /updating /monitoring /communicating/ sharing information with the team, management throughout the project; Also use of office 365 and have email and internet access for research etc.
</p>
     

<br>
<h3>- 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? - Include a link to your Trello board</h3>
    

<a href='https://trello.com/b/YPZ0cjel/bbcbs'>https://trello.com/b/YPZ0cjel/bbcbs</a>

<br>
<p>
I would create a project plan within a set budget, setting out specific goals, each Task, benefits to be achieved; using Trello cards, to help track success. The methodology for my project on the lines of the Waterfall Method whereby, there are 6 set stages (e.g. 1. Planning, 2. Research/Analysis, 3. Design, 4. Code, 5. Testing, 6. Implementation & Maintenance); But each stage is completed in numerical order BEFORE you can move onto the next stage, this method is very useful for small projects like this.
</p>
  
<p>
The project management tools would include Microsoft Word, however (as mentioned above), Trello  will be useful with being a simple to use project management tool whereby you organise a project into boards; allowing you to assign cards (tasks) to different board stages and these cards can be easily moved between boards. Cards in Trello contain comments, attachments (e.g. word documents), due dates that can be synced with calendars.
 HTML/CSS will be used in the design and styling stage of the website and coding stages via VS code user.

<h3>- 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>

<P>
The main risk/reasons for digital projects failing for say large/complex projects are in the main related to timescale due to long length of time taken to complete a project. The original scope of the project may no longer fit the direction of the client’s needs/business strategy, lacking the correct expertise within the project team to have been able to pick this up at a much earlier stage during the project. However, the project plan could have been fixed and not able to be varied to accommodate change during project stages, e.g. Waterfall Project which is not suitable for large/complex long timescale projects.  Align Project more suitable in this case whereby, you’d map out a list of requirements and pick off the highest priority one (each in turn), working directly with the client and are able to deliver a version quickly.
</P>

<P>   
Another issue is sometime a digital project is based on the IT and Information System needs of only 1 service/department’s future needs, without taking into account the future needs of other departments or services of the business and likely impact of changes to just 1 department or service on the rest of the organisations IT &IS. Also, digital projects can fail due to budget pressures, due to spiralling cost and/or insufficient budget originally set aside for the project.
</P>
<br>
<p> 
Please note recent research by manchesterdigital.com whose findings in brief as follows
</p>
<p>
“The most common reasons given for projects to fail were
</p>
<br>
<p>
<ul>   
<li>Short term priorities taking over</li>
<li>The initial scope was poorly defined (and the initial strategy / vision was unclear)</li> 
<li>Trying to do too much work all at once</li>
<li>Silos between marketing and IT </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
Foggett added: “As well as some obvious reasons for projects to fail – including lack of strategy, measurement and unsuitable organisational structure for a 21st century digital business - the findings hint at another problem; are current operating conditions so challenging that, although companies know how they need to develop new products and platforms, the difficulty in doing so while keeping the business running is simply too great?”

<h3> - 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
<p>  
Like I have done for the previous questions I have analysed the business needs requirements, researched all the available IT systems and software, in my case this being a straight forward small and short time scale project, the waterfall method suits my needs with the chosen systems and software etc highlighted in question 1.3 above and will assist my needs to grow the business/website which meets my present needs. The website is designed in such a way that I will have a template to further develop a prototype as a backup and I will be looking to get support and further training to assist me as required.  This approach should always be taken to ensure you select the right kind of IT systems and software to do the job you require.
</p>
<br>

<h3>- 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your code's version control</h3>
<P>   
Trello allowed me to organise my workload in a clear and easy to follow layout, by setting up 3 different boards, e.g. 1. To Do, 2. Doing, 3. Done. This enabled me to quickly update and keep my tasks in an orderly fashion on the bases of my 6. Project stages (e.g. 1. Planning, 2 Research/Analysis, 3. Design, 4. Code, 5. Testing, 6. Implementation & Maintenance). This was useful in checking the progress status of each task to completion by updating each task on each of the 3 boards in a timely manner.
</p>

<p>
GitHub is an online plate form service which uses the tool/software Git which acts as a tracker for changes in file’s source codes. They are both beneficial in assisting in software development because they can both, store/retain each file version, therefore creating a backup  e.g. for comparisons between different file versions, therefore, assisting to highlight differences and allow versions to be merged before commencing coding stage.
</p>  
<br>

           
<h3>- 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
<p> 
In terms of Market Research, the GDPR rule’s introduced on 25th May 2018 prevents the previous blanket tick box approach to consent and now companies/business must get users/client/customers consent for each type of service etc, clearly explaining what  personal information/data will be used for. It is no longer acceptable to try and tie in consent with signing up for a service or tying them in with terms and conditions, Consent is to be treated as a separate entity with an opt out option.
