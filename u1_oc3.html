<h2>Unit 1 Outcome 3 (Review)</h2>

<h3> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
<p>   
The benefits of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency is you can record, manage, and monitor all task(s) e.g. Trello in 1 place than review different platforms/systems to achieve deadlines. By listing all tasks in 1 place, tasks job roles can be clearly defined which can ensures the scope of the project remains on track and can avoid the  project widening and become bigger than is practical. Also, time management during the project is more manageable and effective, reduces the need for increase in costs, e.g. staying in budget.  Disadvantages, being new to using these project tools and systems required training just before starting, likely certain tasks took longer.  Whereas, if it were a project team could have allocated ALL intended tasks based of team members strengths/experience. Therefore, as a team would have been more productive and efficient.

<h3>- 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p>
This is achieved by increasing qualitative work output within a reasonable timescale, which can create opportunities to development new projects for advancement and growth. However, often to best way to improve productivity and efficiency is finding a faster, simple, and easy to follow process/procedure for what is to be achieved. This can be done by ensuring there are sufficient usable resources available; When allocating task(s) ensure they are fully understood and will not be over complicated for team member(s) to be able to complete in expected timescale. Therefore, essential there is clear lines of communication to ensure the delegation of tasks improves the overall workflow within the project or organisation.

<h3>- 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Teamwork? Use of Slack?</h3>
<p>
 Depending on the size of the project even if a small team, it would be better to divide tasks based on team members strengths, still using Trello which would enable tasks on the 3  (1. To Do 2. Doing and 3. Done) board cards to clearly identify which team member assigned to each task, with timescale and deadline dates. This would enable all the team to be able to review to see how each deadline impact on each other and giving a clear bigger picture of the total project and tracking stages etc. Slack could be used to set up a team group to share ideas, links, research etc between the team, ask questions and keeping in touch with each other.   
</p>

<h3>- 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
<p>
The testing should be done continuous and correctly from the start for the value to the business. This should include building strong testing quality assurance practices which drives future development. Testing would involve different test design techniques of each item/tester, which would test the design, e.g. flow of both data & controls, the path and branch. It is useful to write detailed bug reports and clear test cases; implement user acceptance and testing conduct formal technical reviews.
